# Project Management Discussion
Overall, the team has worked exceptionally well together over the course of this project. Generally, communications have consistently been clear allowing everyone to remain focused on their assigned tasks. The team utilised our WhatsApp group chat and Tuleap to share updates and raise any concerns. This allowed the team to remain organised and ensure that any problems that arose were addressed and sorted out effectively. During busy periods our structured approach helped the team remain focused and organised so that we can cohesively work to get as a team to create a successful project. Furthermore, any team member was also able to get help from fellow team members when needed. Weekly scrum meetings were a crucial part of keeping the project on the right track. It allowed us to review earlier prints, to review our progress and plan our next steps. Overtime our meetings became more efficient due to our regular progress updates and closely followed scrum structure. This improved our discussions as it allowed us to remain focused and entailed that everyone was aware of their responsibilities. 

At times, responses to messages were slow, or team members completed tasks without clearly communicating which items they had taken on. This occasionally left others unsure about whether certain tasks were being worked on or if they still needed attention. This is an area we recognise still needs improvement, and we aim to address it in future projects. We did not record our stand-up meetings in Tuleap. Instead, the team held quick stand-ups verbally at the start of each lab session and used our group chat to share daily progress and blockers. This method worked effectively for us because everyone was already present during the lab time, and using the chat allowed team members to update each other when working outside scheduled hours. Although Tuleap provides a useful place to store stand-up logs, our team found that using the chat for short updates was faster and more practical. For future sprints, we could improve traceability by recording brief stand-up summaries in Tuleap so that progress and blockers are documented more formally.
