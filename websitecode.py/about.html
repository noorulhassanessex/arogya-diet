            <h2>Why We Built This Project</h2>
            <p>
                This project was created as part of a university assignment to demonstrate web development 
                skills using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The aim was to build a fully functional 
                tool with clean UI, good routing, templates, and user-friendly interaction.
